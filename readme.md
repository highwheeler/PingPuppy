PingPuppy - an Open Source Cheap Yellow Display (CYD) project to monitor and reboot a router.

It connects to WiFi and pings 3 different hosts. If none of the pings work it eventually times out and cycles relay 1 which would be connected to the router power supply. 

The CYD used is from amazon https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DKSY19C8 and uses the quad I2C relay module https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F944TR1W
The GUI uses LVGL and is designed with Squareline Studio.

This is an ongoing project and I will be expanding it to connect to the PingPuppy.com service to provide additional functionality.
I will also be working on a 3d printed case for it.
